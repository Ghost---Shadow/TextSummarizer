COMPANIES that announce breakthroughs in medical science usually get a hero's welcome.In an area which prides itself on being the cradle of socialism a century ago, it was regarded as an evil changeling, not least because the Tory government had promised a £30m grant to help build it.This view might also have been thought by critics to be justified when Gavin Kenny, a professor of anaesthesia at Glasgow University, shifted his research team from Glasgow Royal Infirmary to HCI, lured by lavish facilities.Extensive testing of the equipment has sufficiently impressed the authorities which regulate medical equipment in Britain and, so far, four other countries, to make this the first such machine to be licenced for commercial sale to hospitals.Mr Kenny says that studies in America have shown that, although the drug costs about $14 (£9) more per operation than conventional drugs, faster patient recovery time can save about $400 per patient.
