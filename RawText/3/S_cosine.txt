In an area which prides itself on being the cradle of socialism a century ago , it was regarded as an evil changeling , not least because the Tory government had promised a £30m grant to help build it .But Mr Kenny 's move speeded up work on a machine which uses micro-computers to control the rate at which an anaesthetic is pumped into the blood of patients undergoing surgery .Tests at HCI , which is using Mr Kenny 's machine on all its patients , and at other hospitals show that the machine cuts the proportion of patients suffering nausea to less than 10 % .Anaesthetists who have either tried the machine , or seen it demonstrated at medical conferences , are enthusiastic .The Edinburgh house in which Sir James Young Simpson , another Scottish doctor , discovered the first modern anaesthetic , chloroform , in 1846 has a commemorative plaque on it .
