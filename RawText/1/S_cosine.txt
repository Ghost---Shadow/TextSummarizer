Matritech 's test , which the company expects the Food and Drug Administration to approve by this summer , measures the amount of a particular type of protein in urine .The unusual proteins seem to explain why the nuclei of cancer cells are often oddly shaped .A negative result meant patients had a 90 percent chance of cancer not developing in the next three to six months-a useful predictive ability , because that is the usual interval between follow-up visits for bladder cancer patients .Chubb states that Matritech has strong patent protection for all uses of nuclear matrix proteins as cancer diagnostics and that it is working on such tests for early detection of prostate , colon , cervical and breast cancer .The difficulty is that drugs have trouble penetrating cell nuclei .
