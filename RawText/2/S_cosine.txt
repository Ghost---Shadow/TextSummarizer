When Microsoft in 1993 hired Eric Horvitz , David Heckerman and Jack Breese , pioneers in the development of Bayesian systems , colleagues in the field were surprised..Early students of probability applied the ideas to discussions about the existence of God or efforts to improve their odds in gambling .The Bayesian approach filled a void in the decades-long effort to add intelligence to computers .Scott Musman , a computer consultant in Arlington , Va. , recently designed a Bayesian network for the Navy that can identify enemy missiles , aircraft or vessels and recommend which weapons could be used most advantageously against incoming targets .And skeptics insist any computer reasoning system will always fall short of people 's expectations because of the computer 's tendency to miss what is often obvious to the human expert .
